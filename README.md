PuppetCamp Chicago 2014:  Custom Types and Providers
========================

Hello!  Thank you for taking a look at the material - I hope you find it useful.

Here's a quick rundown of what you'll find here:

  1.  A Keynote presentation that was given at PuppetCamp Chicago on August 19, 2014.
  2.  An example project demonstrating a custom type/provider that installs the
      "Wordpress CLI" tool.  (See [http://wp-cli.org][wp-cli] for more detail on the WP-CLI project.)
  3.  A vagrant environment that allows you to see the provisioning in action.  (See [http://vagrantup.com][vagrant] to get started using Vagrant.)
  
  [wp-cli]: http://wp.cli.org
  [vagrant]: http://vagrantup.com
  
Here's what this presentation will cover:

  1.  An overview of the "Puppet Learning Curve" - progressing from manifests, to modules to defined types.
  2.  An accounting of the problems that users might encounter with the Puppet language / DSL. Many new users can struggle with what they perceive as 'shortcomings' of Puppet in managing scripting-style tasks.
  3.  A brief introduction to extending Puppet with custom types and providers - mainly looking through the example provided here.
